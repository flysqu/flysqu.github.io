                The internet! I really love messing around on the internet making stuff, well kinda like this! With that
                also comes programming so i guess i find that fun too :3
            </p>
            <p>
                Movies and TV shows. I enjoy those too! My favorite movie has gotta be Nimona! Its so much fun and has a
                really awesome message, watch it!!!! I dont really watch many movies, well other then nimona (i've watched it atleast 10 times)

                Heartstopper is probably my favorite non-animated tv show, im such a huge fan of hearstopper in general.
                i have all the comics! (Heartstopper 1-5). Honestly like the comics more then the tv show #justiceforaled. Im also just in general a really big fan of Alice oseman, I love her novels too especially Solitare and Radio Silence

            <p>
                I also watch anime thats probably the type of media i consume most to be honest. I really love Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, but i think my favourite is probably Love Is War? Maybe Sasaki To Miyano,,,, its so hard to pick a favourite
