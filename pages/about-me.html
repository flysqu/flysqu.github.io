                                year! it's I Saw The TV Glow!!!!!!!!! It went so
                                fucking hard, i think its the most artsy
                                <s>movie</s> film ive ever watched/enjoyed

                                Nimona was my previous favourite one, i love the
                                movie but it does have some flaws, like how many
                                kid focused jokes it has *glares at todd*. but
                                its really good regardless totally recommend

                                elric's the feelings of dysphoria over his body,
                                its defenitly not the exact same but i like, get
                                it. And i fucking love greed's arc of accepting

                                he has a very ironic humour and you can never

                                serious, like schlatt sorta. I found him by the
                                george santos fortnite friday, been enjoying his
                                streams :3

                                Aztroscist/Astrid Ztar, i dont watch alot of her stuff, 
                                like streams and stuff but her site (EU timezone with a ok sleep schedule D:) 
                                <a href="https://www.insect.christmas">insect.christmas</a>. She's why i decided
                                to go make this website and go through all tld's and i found .pink, 
                                totally worth the extra money. i found her content through sleep deprived and 
                                decided to google her since she's funny and found <a href="https://www.insect.christmas">insect.christmas</a>.

                                Atrioc, i watch alot of atrioc videos since he knows quite alot about like
                                economics. I dont agree with him on everything, we are ideologically
                                quite different but i do learn alot about economics and how capatalism 
                                works which is quite usefull living in a capatalistic world i feel

                                Hasanabi, watch some of his stuff more about the politics then the economy
                                since i feel that atrioc has more nuanced takes then Hasan about that kind
                                of stuff. Idk mostly depends on what pops up on my home screen 
                                (alot of his videos are a bit depressing so i sometimes avoid him)
