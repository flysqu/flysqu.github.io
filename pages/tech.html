                <p>As of writing this i have three laptops</p>
                <p>
                    <a id="macbook" class="laptopName">Macbook Air M2 8GB <img class="imageIcon" src="../imageicon.svg"> </a> (Got it in December 2024). I really like
                    this laptop, well yeah i like the laptop but i dont love
                    macos, yet... ill probably never truly love macos not
                    vanilla macos at least. I like what ive done with macos now
                    though but i have like 5 different apps to fix different
                    things that i dont like. I currently use AltTab (Makes the
                    window switcher actually usable for me), MediaMate (More for
                    visuals and to make the notch a bit less annoying to look
                    at), Rectangle (Keyboard window controls), SmoothScroll (To
                    make external mice not be forced to have the same scrolling
                    direction as trackpad), Taskbar (Make the dock more like
                    windows, i dont like the dock, it sucks imo). So yeah i
                    honestly hate vanilla macos, soooooo much is missing, but it
                    is usable and its not impossible to daily drive for me with
                    some additions. I LOVE THE HARDWARE, IT MAKES ALL OF THIS
                    WORTH IT, like it feels so smooth and fast and it never
                    really gets hot, the only time ive felt it slightly warm was
                    when i played "Get to work" for like 4 hours straight. And
                    when i say warm i mean like it was still comfortable to use
                    and not uncomfortable
                </p>

                    <a id="surface" class="laptopName">Microsoft Surface 3 <img class="imageIcon" src="../imageicon.svg"></a>. this laptop was gotten for school, it
                    gets a bit loud and i midly dont like the keyboard but its
                    good enough. i use throttlestop to get it to a bit quiter
                    level but it still isnt the best, but i knew that when i
                    bought it lol. it gets pretty good battery life, around 4
                    and a half hours of watching twitch (thanks dougdoug for
                    that battery test) update: it's battery life is way too bad
                    for school, like it gets to 15% 2 classes into school, so im
                    considering a macbook right now just for their battery life
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a id="thinkpad" class="laptopName">Thinkpad T450 <img class="imageIcon" src="../imageicon.svg"></a>. i got this one for like 130$? i think,
                    something like that. i really like this laptop, my main use
                    for it is as a backup if the surface breaks and for messing
                    around with linux. some of the stuff i've done with it is
                    LFS, gentoo and hackintoshing it. also yeah i have uh a lot
                    of stickers on it lmao, i like them :3 i've help back on my
                    surface since im gonna be using it for school lmao

                                I modded my dualshock 4 to have a usb-c
                                connector instead of a micro-usb! It works
                                really well (unlike the original micro-usb plug
                                lol), i did fuck it up slightly but uh... it
                                works, visually its not the best though, since
                                you have to like manually make the original
                                micro usb hole bigger with a small sanding
                                thingy.

                                I love my dualsense like its real neat and i
                                like it a lot. the triggers are cool :3 I use
                                some thingy to make the triggers harder to press
                                for euro truck sim, i havent really modded it
                                yet but the same guy that made the usb-c mod is
                                making a hall effect sensor mod for basically
                                all controllers? think so, not sure when that
                                will be released but when it is i will totally
                                mod it
                            </p>

                <p>
                    As of 04.06.2025 im still daily driving a Pixel 7 Pro but i got a used <a id="pixel3a" class="laptopName">Pixel 3a<img class="imageIcon" src="../imageicon.svg"></a> that currently has PostmarketOS. 
                    Im currently setting it up to become my daily driver. 
                    Its a weird feeling to ssh onto my phone to change some flatpak repositories lmao, 
                    but i think it will still be an enjoyable experience.
                    Right now i think the biggest downside is that the cameras like barelyyyy work, 
                    like the front cam has a weird green and grainy and the main camera is purple and grainy, like they output pictures,,, 
                    technically but they arent very uh usable.
