            <header>Laptops!</header>
            <p>
                As of writing this i have two laptops
            </p>
            <p>
                Microsoft Surface 3. this laptop was gotten for school, 
                it gets a bit loud and i midly dont like the keyboard but its good enough.
                i use throttlestop to get it to a bit quiter level but it still isnt the best, but i knew that when i bought it lol.
                it gets pretty good battery life, around 4 and a half hours of watching twitch (thanks dougdoug for that battery test)
            </p>
            <p>
                Thinkpad T450. i got this one for like 130$? i think, something like that.
                i really like this laptop, my main use for it is as a backup if 
                the surface breaks and for messing around with linux. 
                some of the stuff i've done with it is LFS, gentoo and hackintoshing it.
                also yeah i have uh a lot of stickers on it lmao, i like them :3
                i've help back on my surface since im gonna be using it for school lmao
            </p>

            <header>Dualshock 4 Mod!</header>
            <p>
                I modded my dualshock 4 to have a usb-c connector instead of a micro-usb! It works really well (unlike the original micro-usb plug lol), i did fuck it up slightly but uh... it works :), visually its not the best though.
